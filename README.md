<h1 style = "text-align: center">Salutations! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

Driven by intrigue, I have always admired the manner in which technology continuously reforms lives. It did not take long to realize this aspect of technology is what I would like to contribute to. A former Mechanical Engineer, I am currently pursuing graduate studies at Purdue University, in the field of Computer and Information Science. My interests primarily lie in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

This page is meant to serve as a scrapbook, wherein I record my journey and contributions, as I aim to make it in this very exciting, albeit challenging, industry. If you found any of my work helpful, well, that makes me glad!
